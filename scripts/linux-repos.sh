# <packages-dir> holds the releases' Linux packages (qso-graph-desktop-<version>-linux-*.deb|rpm). The

#   rpm/x86_64/, rpm/aarch64/   each .rpm signed with rpmsign; createrepo_c's metadata, repomd.xml
#                               signed (repomd.xml.asc), for gpgcheck and repo_gpgcheck both
#   apt/pool/main/              the .deb files
#   apt/dists/stable/           Packages for amd64 and arm64; Release, signed as InRelease and Release.gpg

#   qso-graph-desktop.gpg       the same key, binary, for apt's signed-by=
#   qso-graph-desktop.repo      the file dnf users put in /etc/yum.repos.d/
#
# Signed with the release key (KI7MT, 2026-10-27), and only that key: SIGNING_KEY is its fingerprint,
# and the run stops unless the keyring in GNUPGHOME holds a secret key with exactly that fingerprint.
# PASSPHRASE_FILE holds its passphrase. The key itself is the caller's to import; nothing here prints it.

# A package already served is kept, not signed again (#143). A signature carries the time it was
# made, so signing anew gives a file of the same size and different bytes: the upload, which never
# rewrites a package, kept the old one, and the index named the new one. dnf refused every package
# but the newest after the first rebuild, and the newest too when Promote ran twice. The served copy
# is kept only if it is this release's package (header and payload digests equal) and carries a
# signature that verifies against the release key; anything else is signed here as before.
